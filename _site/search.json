The point spread (betting line) are highlighted in 4 plots to highlight the probable distribution of the mean margin of victory.\nClick here to access project GitHub repository.\nProject was created in conjunction with Kane’s Free Data Science Bootcamp."

    "text": "NFL point spread is a major focus point for those looking to place wagers on the upcoming weekly games during the football season.\nThe data downloaded from Kaggle: NFL scores and betting data, contained an array of variables nested in a series of individual csv and xml files. This project’s sole focus centered around point spread. Therefore, only csv files with the title suffix “lines.csv” from the dataset were extracted for use.\nAfter importing the data using the read_csv() function, the immediate efforts were centered on tidying the data using a number of functions - janitor::clean_names() to generate compatible variable names, mutate() to add columns, select() to focus on the variables of interest, and rename() to rename variables.\nA Bayesian regression model was generated, with margin of victory as the dependent variable and point spread (absolute) as the independent variable.\nThe plots generated from the Bayesian linear model highlight an increasing probable mean margin of victory as the point spread increases, which makes sense since those matchups are often a case of a superior opponent versus an inferior opponent. When the spread is greater than 7 points, the average margin of victory is in the neighborhood of 16 points. Overall, most games are decided by double digits.\nWhat is the expected mean margin of victory?"
