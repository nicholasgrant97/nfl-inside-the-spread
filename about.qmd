## About this Project

This [project](https://github.com/nicholasgrant97/nfl-inside-the-spread) explores the probable mean margin of victory (points differential) in NFL regular season games from 1978 through 2013. The point spread (betting line) are highlighted in 4 plots to highlight the probable distribution of the mean margin of victory. 

This Project was created in conjunction with [Kaneâ€™s Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
